CodeBridge – Assignment 2 Planning
Project Partner: Working alone

Vision for the site:
Originally, I wanted to build something useful for MRU computer science students. 
The idea was to make tutoring feel more approachable, like getting help from a friend who’s already taken the course. 
That’s where the name CodeBridge came from — bridging the gap between confusion and clarity.

I kept the branding simple and modern, aiming for a clean and minimal look with a tech vibe. 
Since then, I’ve made a lot of updates to improve both the design and functionality based on what I’ve learned and researched on my own.

Changes from original A1 version:
	•	Combined all pages into one single index.html instead of three separate pages. This made the experience smoother and more modern.
	•	Replaced the services table with a responsive 2x2 subject grid. Each block links straight to the contact form and auto-fills the subject.
	•	Updated the contact form with a dropdown, optional fields for “Other,” and a thank-you message after submission.
	•	Added smooth scroll behavior and a “Back to Top” button for better navigation.
	•	Used AOS (Animate On Scroll) to add some subtle motion as you scroll down.

Design decisions:
	•	Kept the blue/white/gray color scheme for a clean and academic look.
	•	Hero section now has a faded background image to add life without distracting from the text.
	•	Navigation bar updated: logo stays on the far left, menu items float to the right.
	•	Everything is mobile-friendly with proper responsive breakpoints.

Tools used:
	•	VS Code
	•	GitHub for version control
	•	Formspree for the contact form
	•	AOS library for scroll animations

Some tools (like GitHub and Formspree) I’ve been learning privately and practicing outside class. 
I also spent time researching ideas online and customizing things based on what I found. 
This project helped me put a lot of those skills into action.
